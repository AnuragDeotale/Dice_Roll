# Dice Roller ðŸŽ²

This is a simple Python-based dice roller program that simulates rolling a 6-sided dice. You can use it to roll the dice as many times as you'd like!

## Features
- Roll a dice to generate random numbers between 1 and 6.
- Displays the dice face in a text-based graphical format.
- User-friendly prompts for interaction.
- Exits gracefully upon user request.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user if they want to roll the dice.
2. If the user inputs `Y` or `y`, the program rolls the dice and displays the result as a text-based dice face.
3. If the user inputs `N` or `n`, the program thanks the user and exits.
4. For any other input, the program prompts the user to provide valid input.
